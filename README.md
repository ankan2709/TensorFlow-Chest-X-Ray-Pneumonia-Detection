# TensorFlow-Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detection

In this notebook we use the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia dataset to build a Deep Learning Model to detect if an X-Ray image shows the presence of Pneumonia or not. We will build a Convolution Neural Network to train and predict the results. We will also perform Data Augmentation using the Image Generator class which can be used to generate batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation.
